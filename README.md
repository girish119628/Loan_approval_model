# 📌 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
  ✔️ Removal of unwanted spaces in column names and values (str.strip()) is excellent.

  ✔️ Checked for duplicates and nulls.
  
  ✔️ Created a new meaningful feature (total_assets) and dropped redundant columns.

  ✔️ Categorical and numerical columns identified clearly.

# Suggestions:

  * You could include a missing value imputation step using SimpleImputer for both numeric and categorical data (even if you don't have many nulls—it shows good practice).

  * Log-transform or use PowerTransformer for highly skewed features if needed.

# 📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  ✔️ Used count plots, scatter plots, and box plots to uncover patterns.

  ✔️ Outlier detection via IQR method is excellent.

  ✔️ Correlation heatmap is included.

# Suggestions:

  * For categorical variables, consider using groupby() with .mean() or .value_counts(normalize=True) to understand their relation with the target variable (loan_status).

  * Use pairplot or violin plots for deeper distribution insights (optional).

# 🧠 3. Model Training
  ✔️ Used a variety of classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting.

  ✔️ Built a reusable pipeline with preprocessing and modeling.

  ✔️ Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

  ✔️ Created a visual comparison across models (bar plots).

  ✔️ Plotted confusion matrices for all models.

# Suggestions:

  * Consider using StratifiedKFold cross-validation with cross_val_score for robust model evaluation instead of a single train-test split.

  * You might also try XGBoost or LightGBM for better performance in real-world cases.

# 🔍 4. Hyperparameter Tuning
  ✔️ Set up param_grids for multiple models using GridSearchCV.

# Suggestions:

  * You might want to isolate and run the GridSearch for the best-performing model (e.g., RandomForest or GradientBoosting).

  * Save the best model using joblib or pickle for deployment or reuse.
